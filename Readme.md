### Data Description

#### Sensors

1. **Tank water level sensor** (star icon next to pump): measured in **meters**.  
2. **Flow sensors** (3, green):  
   - Two at DMA inflows  
   - One at the pump  
   - Measured in `m³/h`  
3. **Pressure sensors** (33, red):  
   - 5-minute time step  
   - Measured in **meters**  
4. **Automated Metered Readings (AMRs)** (82) from Area C:  
   - Provide user water consumption  
   - Measured in `L/h`  

#### Time Step

- SCADA time step: **5 minutes**

#### Leaks

1. Two types: **abrupt leaks** and **incipient leaks** (gradually develop into bursts).  
2. In **2018**, some leaks were detected and fixed; others may have occurred but were **not identified**.  
3. Leak **labels are available only** for those that were **located and fixed** during 2018.  
4. In **2019**, most leaks were located, and **critical ones were repaired**.  
5. **Objective**: Detect and locate leaks from **2019** as accurately and quickly as possible.  
6. Leak **locations are given at the pipe scale**.

#### Demand

1. **Base demands** assigned to nodes based on historical data of nearby consumers.  
2. **Two demand patterns**: residential and commercial consumers.  
3. **Weekly demand profiles** are provided for both types, but **yearly seasonality is not captured**.

#### Uncertainty

1. Inaccuracies in the model, especially regarding **pipe roughness** and **diameters**.  
2. **Valve status** (open/closed) is uncertain.

#### EPANET Model

1. Contains **nominal parameters** and **weekly demand profiles** with ~10% variation.  
2. Parameters like **diameter** and **roughness** differ from the actual network by ~10%.
